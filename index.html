<p>Hi, i'm Stevan, 48, Welsh and bald, living in Manchester
I shop at Primark, sniff scented at B&M,and i'm addicted to Greggs pasties.

<p>I have a condition called Irlen Syndrome, and my preferred coloured
filter is purple. Before being diagnosed, I never read a book from 
cover to cover. Also, old books makes me feel uncomfortable.<p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>I prefer to wear joggers and baggy hoodies over trousers and shirts. 
I have two wardrobes, one is for everyday day clothes, the other is full of 
clothes that are to small for me, waiting patiently for me to lose weight.<p>
